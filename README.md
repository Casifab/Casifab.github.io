# PERSONAL SITE
This is my personal site (and first) personal site hosted on Github.
I build it using the 'create-react-app' feature with the purpose of training with
the [React](https://reactjs.org/) library.

### Every description of person (or animal) represented in this site is subjective.

The project has a very horrible implementation, caused by the fact that this is my
experience with this kind of library.

You can watch the result [here](https://Casifab.github.io).

#### Thank you for reading :+1:
